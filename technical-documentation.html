      <p>Web development is the art and science of creating websites and web applications that are accessible, functional, and visually appealing. It combines multiple disciplines, including HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity, to deliver seamless user experiences across devices. This documentation explores the core technologies behind modern web development, providing a foundation for understanding how websites are built from the ground up.
      </p>
      <p>A key starting point is understanding the structure of a webpage, which begins with a standard declaration.
      </p>
      <code>The !DOCTYPE html declaration must be the first line of an HTML document to ensure browsers render it correctly.
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>Hello</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="html">
      <header>HTML</header>
      <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the backbone of every webpage, providing the structure and content that browsers interpret to display text, images, links, and more. It uses a system of tags to define elements like headings, paragraphs, and lists, creating a semantic hierarchy that improves accessibility and search engine optimization. 
      </p>
      <p>HTML5, the latest version, introduced features like native video and audio support, making it more powerful for modern web applications. A fundamental aspect of HTML is its use of attributes to enhance elements.
      </p>
      <code>
        The "id" attribute, as in div id="main", provides a unique identifier for an element, allowing targeted styling or scripting.
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>World</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="css">
      <header>CSS</header>
      <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is the language used to style and layout HTML elements, transforming raw content into visually engaging designs. It controls properties like colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning, enabling developers to create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
      </p>
      <p>CSS operates on a cascade principle, where styles are applied based on specificity and order, offering fine-grained control over appearance. One powerful feature of CSS is its ability to apply styles conditionally.
      </p>
      <code>The :hover pseudo-class, as in a:hover {color: blue;}, changes an element’s style when a user mouses over it.
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>This</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="javascript">
      <header>Javascript</header>
      <p>JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that adds interactivity and functionality to websites, enabling features like form validation, animations, and real-time updates without page reloads. Running in the browser, it manipulates the Document Object Model (DOM) to change content and respond to user actions, making it essential for modern web applications.
      </p>
      <p>JavaScript’s versatility extends to server-side development with environments like Node.js, broadening its impact. A core mechanism in JavaScript is event handling.
      </p>
      <code>The addEventListener method, as in element.addEventListener('click', function), attaches a function to an element that runs when clicked.
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>Is</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <p>Building a website requires the harmonious interplay of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, each serving a distinct role in creating user-friendly, responsive, and interactive experiences. By mastering these technologies, developers can craft everything from simple static pages to complex web applications, meeting the diverse needs of users and businesses.
      </p>
      <p>As web development continues to evolve, staying updated with new standards and tools ensures creations remain relevant and effective. A final consideration is optimizing for performance.
      </p>
      <code>Minifying CSS and JavaScript files, such as removing whitespace, reduces file size and improves page load speed.
